# Baja_Timing_Gates
  * Timing Gates to measure various time trials for Baja
    * Using two pressure switches connected to liquid filled tubes
    * Start and stop times will be recorded by arduino connected to both sensors
    * All code will be commited as .ino file type
    * Arduino UNO board is being used
    * Currently, standard 14/2 wire will be used to relay switch response
   
  * To do:
    * Replace cables between start/stop sensors with X-Bee or Bluetooth module (with minimum delay and maximum accuracy)
     * Can be done using a buffer
    * Add mechanism to hold tubes down to prevent them from getting stuck in between tire threads
    * Preferrably accurate to the millisecond, but up to 1 second accuracy is sufficient
    * Test with 400 lb weight
    * Use rubber plugs on other side of tubing
